# Don Cheli: Senior Tech Panel

## Panel Members

Each expert has 15+ years of experience and must back every argument with a real-world incident, benchmark, or published case study:

| Expert              | Domain                                             |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Tech Lead           | Code quality, team velocity, maintainability       |
| Sr. Backend Engineer| API design, DB performance, concurrency, latency   |
| Sr. Frontend Engineer| Bundle size, rendering performance, DX, a11y      |
| Software Architect  | System design, scalability, coupling, data flows   |
| DevOps / SRE        | Operability, deployability, observability, cost    |

## Instructions

1. Read the technical question or architecture decision to evaluate
2. Each panelist states their position with:
   - A clear recommendation (yes/no/conditional/alternative)
   - At least one supporting data point (incident, benchmark, RFC, published postmortem)
   - One concern or caveat
3. Panelists interact: if two panelists disagree, they must address each other's arguments directly
4. Conclude with a panel consensus or a documented dissent

## Output Format

```
## Tech Panel: <topic>

### Tech Lead
**Position:** …
**Evidence:** …
**Concern:** …

### Sr. Backend Engineer
**Position:** …
**Evidence:** …
**Concern:** …

### Sr. Frontend Engineer
**Position:** …

### Software Architect
**Position:** …
**Evidence:** …
**Concern:** …

### DevOps / SRE
**Position:** …
**Evidence:** …

### Cross-Debate
<Panelist A> → <Panelist B>: …
…

### Panel Conclusion
**Consensus / Majority recommendation:** …
**Dissent (if any):** …
**Conditions for the recommendation:** …
```

## Quality Gate

- Every panelist must cite at least one real-world data point — no opinions without evidence
- If a panelist's domain is not directly relevant to the question, they must explain why they still have a stake
- Consensus requires ≥3/5 panelists; otherwise output DISSENT with open questions

## Do not use this skill when

- The decision is purely business/product (use doncheli-debate instead)
- The question has a clear industry standard answer (just cite the standard)
