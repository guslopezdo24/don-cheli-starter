# Don Cheli: Test End-to-End Autonomous (TEA)

## Instructions

1. Detect the test runner from `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, or `.dc/config.yaml`
2. Run tests in this order: unit → integration → E2E (stop on catastrophic failure at each tier)
3. Capture stdout/stderr; do not swallow errors silently
4. Categorize results: passed, failed, skipped, flaky (failed then passed on retry)
5. For each failing test, provide:
   - Test name and file path
   - Error message (full, not truncated)
   - Likely root cause (one sentence)
   - Suggested fix (if deterministic)
6. If the same test fails twice in a row with the same error, escalate to the user instead of retrying
7. Report coverage if the runner supports it; flag if below the 85% threshold
8. Save the full report to `.dc/test-report-<timestamp>.md`
9. Exit with a clear pass/fail summary — no ambiguous "some tests failed" messages
